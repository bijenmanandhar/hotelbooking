# hotelbooking
This repo consists of various ML models to make predictive analytics on booking cancellations. Various Sci-Kit ML models as well as Tensorflow were used to build to make different types of models. After doing analysis on model performance based on ROC AUC score, classification reports, and classification matrix, the best model is selected that best fits the purpose of this project. This repo also includes the presentation deck of the project. 

The dataset was collected from Kaggle. The link to the dataset can be found in the first line of .ipynb file.
